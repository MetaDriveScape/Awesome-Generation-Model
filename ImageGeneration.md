## Controllable Generation

### ControlNeXt: Powerful and Efficient Control for Image and Video Generation
[SD][2024.8][preprint]\[[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06070)\]\[[code](https://github.com/dvlab-research/ControlNeXt #)\]
- `Keypoints:` SD; Control
- `Key Takeaways:` remove the control branch and replace it with a lightweight convolution module composed solely of multiple ResNet blocks and replace zero_init with cross normalization. 




## Super Resolution 
### MegaFusion: Extend Diffusion Models towards Higher-resolution Image Generation without Further Tuning
[SD][2024.8][preprint]\[[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11001)\]\[[code](https://haoningwu3639.github.io/MegaFusion/ #)\]
- `Keypoints:` SD; Super Resolution
- `Key Takeaways:` A super resolution method that based on any diffusion models (x2 or x4).
