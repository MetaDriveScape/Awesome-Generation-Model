### Customizing Text-to-Image Diffusion with Camera Viewpoint Control

* [2404.12333\] 
* [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12333)
* [code](https://github.com/customdiffusion360/custom-diffusion360)

- `Keypoints:`Camera control， Text-to-image，NeRF
- `Key Takeaways:`  generate image with accurate camera view, by building a FeatureNeRF from object images and use it as a condition for diffusion
